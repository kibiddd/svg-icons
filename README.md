This is a project created specifically for the practice of (animated) SVG.

All icons are made by @kibiddd from starch with the inspiration seen online/daily life. 

To view the SVG, copy source code and paste in https://www.w3schools.com/tryit/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_hello or https://codepen.io/pen/.

Feel free to inspect, use, and share your ideas :)
